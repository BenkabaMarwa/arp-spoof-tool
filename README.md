# üî• ARP Spoofing Tool (Educational Purpose Only)

This project is a simple **ARP spoofing / ARP poisoning tool** written in Python using **Scapy**.  
It demonstrates how attackers can manipulate the ARP table of a victim and gateway to perform **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attacks.

This tool is created for **educational and research purposes only**.  
Do **NOT** use it on networks without proper authorization. Unauthorized use is **illegal**.
